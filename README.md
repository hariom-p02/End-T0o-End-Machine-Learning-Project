# End-to-End Data Science Project: Model Deployment for Business Optimization

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **complete life cycle of a data science solution**, starting from problem definition to model deployment. It covers:
- Data Collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Model Building & Evaluation
- Deployment using Flask API
- Real-time prediction and performance monitoring

## 🚀 Project Pipeline
1. **Problem Definition:** Understand business objectives and frame the problem.
2. **Data Collection:** Gather data from CSV files or APIs.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features to boost model performance.
5. **Model Training:** Build and fine-tune machine learning models.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like Accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE, and Confusion Matrix.
7. **Model Deployment:** Deploy using Flask API for real-time prediction.
8. **Monitoring:** Set up a framework for tracking model performance over time.
