#End-to-End Data Science Project: Model Deployment for Business Optimization

📚 **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the complete life cycle of a data science solution, starting from problem definition to model deployment. It covers data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment via Flask API, and monitoring strategies for real-world usage.

🚀 **Project Pipeline**
Problem Definition – Understanding the business need and framing the data science problem.

Data Collection – Gathering relevant datasets from CSV files or APIs.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, outliers, and data formatting.

Feature Engineering – Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.

Model Building – Training machine learning models and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation – Using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.

Model Deployment – Building a REST API using Flask for real-time predictions.

Monitoring & Maintenance – Strategies to track model performance and trigger retraining if needed.
